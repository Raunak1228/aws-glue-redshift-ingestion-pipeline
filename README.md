## Project Overview
This project automates the incremental ingestion of data into an AWS Redshift data warehouse using AWS Glue, ensuring that only the latest data is processed. It includes data quality checks, error handling, and notification systems to ensure the integrity of the ingested data. The pipeline is designed to be scalable, cost-effective, and easy to monitor.

### Key Objectives:
1. Automate incremental data ingestion.
2. Ensure data quality through automated checks.
3. Provide notifications for pipeline status and data quality results.
4. Optimize performance and manage costs effectively.

## Architecture
The architecture of the project is designed to leverage various AWS services in a cohesive manner to automate data ingestion and quality assurance processes.

### Components:
- **AWS S3**: Acts as the data lake, storing incoming transaction files.
- **AWS Glue**: Serves as the ETL tool, utilizing job bookmarking for incremental ingestion and running data quality checks.
- **AWS Redshift**: The target data warehouse where clean and validated data is stored.
- **AWS Glue Data Catalog**: Manages schema information for the datasets.
- **Amazon SNS**: Sends notifications to users based on the outcome of the data quality checks.
- **AWS EventBridge**: Triggers SNS notifications based on Glue job results.
- **AWS IAM**: Manages permissions and roles for secure access to services.

### Workflow:
1. **Data Ingestion**: Incoming transaction files are stored in an S3 bucket. AWS Glue's job bookmarking feature identifies and processes only new files.
2. **Data Quality Checks**: AWS Glue applies predefined data quality rules to ensure only valid data is loaded into Redshift.
3. **Data Storage**: Validated data is ingested into Redshift. Records failing the quality checks are dumped into a separate S3 bucket for further analysis.
4. **Notifications**: AWS EventBridge triggers SNS notifications to alert users about the results of the data quality checks.
5. **Monitoring and Reporting**: The outcomes of the quality checks are stored in S3 as JSON files, providing detailed reports on the pipeline's performance.

## Features
- **Incremental Data Ingestion**: Ensures only new data is processed, reducing unnecessary computation and cost.
- **Automated Data Quality Checks**: Validates data before ingestion into Redshift, ensuring high-quality datasets.
- **Error Handling**: Records failing quality checks are isolated in S3 for further action.
- **Notifications**: Automated alerts via SNS notify users about the success or failure of data quality checks.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large volumes of data with efficient resource usage.
- **Cost Management**: Optimized to minimize operational costs through intelligent resource allocation and usage.

## Tech Stack
- **AWS Glue**: For ETL processes and data quality checks.
- **AWS Redshift**: As the data warehouse platform.
- **AWS S3**: For data storage and lake.
- **AWS Glue Data Catalog**: To manage metadata and schema information.
- **Amazon SNS**: For notifications.
- **AWS EventBridge**: To trigger SNS notifications.
- **AWS IAM**: For security and permissions management.
- **Terraform/CloudFormation**: For infrastructure setup (optional).

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- **AWS Account**: Ensure you have an active AWS account with appropriate permissions.
- **AWS CLI**: Install and configure the AWS CLI with your credentials.
- **Terraform/CloudFormation**: (Optional) Install Terraform or AWS CloudFormation if you prefer to automate infrastructure deployment.
- **IAM Roles**: Ensure you have IAM roles with the necessary permissions to interact with S3, Glue, Redshift, SNS, and other services.

### Infrastructure Setup

#### Option 1: Manual Setup
1. **Create S3 Bucket**: 
   - Create a bucket named `financial_trans_bucket` to store transaction files.
   
2. **Set Up Redshift Cluster**: 
   - Create a Redshift cluster and configure it with the necessary database and tables to receive the ingested data.
   
3. **Create Glue Crawler and Jobs**: 
   - Set up a Glue Crawler to catalog the S3 bucket.
   - Create Glue jobs to perform ETL and data quality checks.

4. **Set Up SNS Topic**: 
   - Create an SNS topic to send notifications.
   - Subscribe your email to the topic for receiving alerts.

5. **Set Up EventBridge**: 
   - Create an EventBridge rule to trigger SNS notifications based on Glue job outcomes.

6. **Create IAM Roles**: 
   - Create IAM roles for Glue, Redshift, and other services with appropriate permissions.

#### Option 2: Automated Setup with Terraform/CloudFormation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/aws-glue-redshift-ingestion-pipeline.git
   cd aws-glue-redshift-ingestion-pipeline
   ```
2. **Configure Terraform/CloudFormation**:
   - Navigate to the `infrastructure/terraform/` or `infrastructure/cloudformation/` directory.
   - Update variables and configuration files as needed.
   
3. **Deploy Infrastructure**:
   - For Terraform:
     ```bash
     terraform init
     terraform apply
     ```
   - For CloudFormation:
     ```bash
     aws cloudformation deploy --template-file glue_pipeline.yml --stack-name glue-redshift-pipeline
     ```

### Pipeline Configuration
1. **Upload Sample Data**: 
   - Place your sample parquet file (e.g., `200k_transactions.parquet`) in the S3 bucket (`financial_trans_bucket`).

2. **Create Glue Job**:
   - Configure the Glue job with the Python scripts provided in the `glue_jobs/` directory.
   - Set up job bookmarking to ensure incremental processing.

3. **Set Up Data Quality Rules**:
   - Define your data quality rules in the Glue Data Catalog.

4. **Schedule the Pipeline**:
   - Schedule the Glue job to run daily or as required.

### Testing and Verification
1. **Trigger the Pipeline**:
   - Manually upload a sample file to the S3 bucket to trigger the pipeline.
   
2. **Verify Data Ingestion**:
   - Query the Redshift table to ensure that data has been ingested correctly and that no null values exist in the columns.
   
3. **Check Notifications**:
   - Verify that an email notification was received upon completion of the pipeline run.
   
4. **Review Data Quality Reports**:
   - Inspect the JSON files in S3 to review the outcomes of the data quality checks.

## Performance Optimization
- **Optimize Glue Jobs**: Tune Spark configurations for better performance in AWS Glue. Use partitioning and bucketing in Redshift to speed up queries.
- **Efficient Data Storage**: Use columnar storage formats (e.g., Parquet) for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Parallel Processing**: Leverage Glueâ€™s ability to run multiple jobs in parallel to handle large datasets.
- **Schema Evolution**: Use schema evolution strategies to handle changes in data structure over time without breaking the pipeline.

## Cost Management Strategies
- **Resource Monitoring**: Use AWS Cost Explorer and CloudWatch to monitor resource usage and costs.
- **Spot Instances**: Use AWS Spot Instances for non-critical Glue jobs to reduce costs.
- **Data Lifecycle Policies**: Implement S3 lifecycle policies to transition old data to cheaper storage classes or delete it after a certain period.
- **Cost Alerts**: Set up AWS Budgets to receive alerts when spending exceeds predefined thresholds.
